# Introduction

Simple Add-on to render all your view layers as a viewport render animation. 

Add a view layer, setup the output folder and file output settings. 

Now click Viewport Render Multilayer in the View Menu of the 3D Viewport.

Only the View Layers, enabled for rendering will be renderd. Choose a small frame range to test it first because blender will freeze while the process is running. 

Open a console before starting to see updates.


# Features

- auto-generate folder structure for output, named by the view layers

- enhance visual quality by using Eevee's Ambient Occlusion, Screen Space Reflection or Motion Blur

- render preview within minutes instead of hours

- use blender's video sequence editor to composite your rendered layers
